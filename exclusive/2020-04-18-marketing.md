## TEXT

### INTRODUCTION

Today I wanna talk about **"营销号"** - I can't find any translations of it, so l just call it **"marketing accounts"** ~~(my awful translation)~~. 

Marketing accounts are unique to mainland China. They publish specific information on the Internet for profits. The information is normally about commercial advertisement. However, as the number of netizens in China is badly expanding, they start to provide eye-catching articles and videos, even though these articles and videos are often plagiarized(剽窃的) and fallacious(谬误的), and sometimes discriminatory(歧视的) and provocative(煽动性的). Then they can get millions of clicks and finally change the clicks into money.

### EXAMPLES

As is widely known, a standard article written by marketing accounts comes with an appealing title.

<div align="center"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/04/16/JkMHl6.png"></div>

But most of the time its content does not live up to its title at all. 

The content can be tortuous(冗长的), in order to steal your time and increase the profits.

<div align="center"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/04/16/JkMX0e.png"></div>

It can be ridiculous, as a result of paying no efforts in it.

Otherwise, it just copies not-so-famous works and then tags it as original. (Examples are in the video above)

It even uses popular music, making initially good music disgusting.

### IMPACT

To some degree, marketing accounts who plagiarize mark excellent works on the Internet. But they fail to support the original authors. Instead, they take the profits for themselves and even accuse back the authors of plagiarizing.

As for those who publish poor-quality articles and videos, they just produce network garbages and let them flood into our life.

Worse still, marketing accounts have massive fan bases (usually "water armies"), which give them the power to guide the masses. The huge profits brought by marketing accounts also support the platforms where they operate, allowing them to continue their existence.

### CONCLUSION

Marketing accounts are quite annoying. Nevertheless, this phenomenon can hardly be eliminated. At present, what we can do is to prevent ourselves from being brainwashed and to distinguish between right and wrong.
